# BOILER

Boilerplate for creative web development or whatever

This is an experiment so dont fuck with it unless you understand whats going on. It uses Vite so its fast, virtually no dependencies. Includes scss styles, custom state management, custom preloader for webgl, custom smooth scroll (Allez). basically everything is custom because i wanted it that way.
